# GiysiNet

GiysiNet is a Python library for creating outfit recommendations with deep learning models. This app has four different models. AlexNet, Resnet, VGGNet, GiysiNet.
The project compares both softmax outputs and early CNN layer outputs. The csv and label files can be found in the Files 

# Train and test accuracy

As you can see GiysiNet is better than AlexNet but VGGNet.

# Outputs 
Here you can see some output of the project. The early outputs represented by E on their top left-hand corner. These are all VGG outputs more output can be found in output file.
